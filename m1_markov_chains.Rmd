In this session, we will look at a **Markov Chain**.

A Markov Chain is defined by three properties:

1. A state space: A set of values/states in which a process could exist

2. A transition matrix: Define the probebility of moving from one state to another state

3. A current state probability distribution: Define the probability of being in any one of the states at the start of the process

### Exercise

```{r}
# Create a 2x2 Matrix
# consisting of the transition probabilities shown in the diagram
transitionMatrix = matrix(c(0.4, 0.6, 
                            0.7, 0.3), nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)

print(transitionMatrix)
```
```{r}
rownames(transitionMatrix) <- c("Sunny", "Rainy")
colnames(transitionMatrix) <- c("Sunny", "Rainy")

print(transitionMatrix)
```

Suppose we want to simulate a sequence of 30 days and the weather patterns over those days - Assume that on day 0 it is currently sunny.

```{r}
# initial state 
state <- "Sunny" # Assume that on day 0 it is currently sunny
# vector to store simulated values
weather_sequence <- rep(0, 30) #Replicate the values 0 30 times

# simulate for 30 days
for (day in 1:30) { 
  pr <- transitionMatrix[state, ] # select the row of transition probabilities

  # sample(x, size=n, prob). Take a sample of specified size n from element x
  state = sample(c("Sunny", "Rainy"), size = 1, prob = pr) # Sample "Sunny"/"Rainy" based on pr
  weather_sequence[day] <- state # Store the sampled state
}

# print the simulated weather sequence
print(weather_sequence)
```


### Problem

Can we extend this example to a three-state model?

```{r}
# Create a 3x3 Matrix
# consisting of the transition probabilities shown in the diagram
prob_transitionMatrix = matrix(c(0.7, 0.2, 0.1, 
                                 0.3, 0.3, 0.4, 
                                 0.6, 0.2, 0.2), nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
rownames(prob_transitionMatrix) <- c("Sunny", "Rainy", "Cloudy")
colnames(prob_transitionMatrix) <- c("Sunny", "Rainy", "Cloudy")

print(prob_transitionMatrix)
```

```{r}
# initial state 
prob_state <- "Sunny" # Assume that on day 0 it is currently rainy
# vector to store simulated values
prob_weather_sequence <- rep(0, 30) #Replicate the values 0 30 times

# simulate for 30 days
for (day in 1:30) { 
  prob_pr <- prob_transitionMatrix[prob_state, ] # select the row of transition probabilities

  # sample(x, size=n, prob). Take a sample of specified size n from element x
  prob_state = sample(c("Sunny", "Rainy", "Cloudy"), size = 1, prob = prob_pr) # Sample "Sunny"/"Rainy" based on pr
  prob_weather_sequence[day] <- prob_state # Store the sampled state
}

# print the simulated weather sequence
print(prob_weather_sequence)
```
